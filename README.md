# bioconceptvec-explorer

Goal: develop a tool for exploring and testing biological hypotheses using literature-based concept embeddings, and leverage the tool to discover novel biological insights from the latent knowledge in biomedical literature. 🧠

Project: Use vector operations on BioConceptVec, a collection of embeddings from PubMed abstracts, to make analogies and queries based on existing knowledge. For example, we can use the equation “X - Gene + Drug = Cancer” to find a potential biomarker or target for cancer diagnosis. We also want to validate the results with external evidence from databases and experiments. 🧪

Novelty: We create a tool to explore and test embeddings for biology using BioConceptVec. We also provide ways to check and explain the results with external evidence. 🔬

Impact: The tool unlocks the latent knowledge in biomedical literature and enables novel discoveries in biology. The tool allows researchers to do vector operations on concepts and generate hypotheses beyond term matching or co-occurrence methods. The tool also helps researchers validate and interpret the results with external evidence. 🚀

Team Needs:
Biology Experts: have domain expertise that can be utilized to create interesting queries using vector operations on biological concepts, and interpreting the results using biological knowledge and evidence. Get in touch if you have an interesting equation related to your field that you want to try out. 🧬

Machine Learning Practitioners: experience with concept embedding models, language models, and PyTorch. Get in touch if you have ideas to extend what we’ve proposed to enable researchers to explore the latent space. 🤖

Web Developers: experience with React, D3, and other web technologies for creating user-friendly and interactive interfaces for the tool. Get in touch if you have ideas of how to help them visualize the latent space with the equations they make and an understanding of how to implement them. 💻
